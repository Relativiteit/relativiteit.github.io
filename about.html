        <h3>The Story Behind KantoRobotics</h3>
        <p>Our founder, once a full-time musician, discovered the world of engineering through TinkerCAD. This accessible tool didn't just introduce him to a new discipline, but also gifted him the courage to take a bold leap into mechanical engineering.</p>
        <p>His journey with TinkerCAD led him to the university, where he cultivated lifelong friendships and further nurtured his newfound passion for engineering. Eventually, this passion took him to Japan, the land of the rising sun.</p>
        <p>In Japan, he started creating innovative tools, using his engineering skills for more than just functional applications but also for artistic expressions. This journey wasn't just about acquiring new skills; it was a road to self-liberation.</p>
        <p>With KantoRobotics, he aspires to offer the same empowerment by making robotics accessible to everyone, regardless of their background. His vision is to create a platform where anyone can design and bring robots to life right from their browser.</p>
        <p>This dream, conceived from a tool that changed one life, now aims to inspire many more across the globe.</p>
